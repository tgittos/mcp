# Current Task: Analyze Existing Codebase Structure

## Context
- Current phase: Planning and Analysis
- Priority level: High
- Estimated complexity: Moderate

## Task Description
Study the current MCP implementation to understand the existing codebase structure, identify integration points with the Ralph system, and document the existing architecture and patterns. This analysis will inform the design of the Ralph core architecture and ensure seamless integration.

## Input Files
- specs/ralph-core.md: Core system specification
- specs/prompt-engine.md: Prompt management system specification
- specs/subagent-system.md: Subagent architecture specification
- specs/memory-management.md: Context window handling specification
- specs/workflow-phases.md: Phase definitions specification
- specs/file-management.md: File-based state management specification
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: Current implementation plan
- AGENT.md: Build process learnings
- src/mcp/: Existing MCP implementation
- src/ralph/: Existing Ralph implementation (if any)

## Constraints
- Memory limit: ~156kb for main process
- Subagent limit: Up to 100 parallel subagents for analysis
- Time limit: None specified

## Expected Output
- Files to create/modify: 
  - AGENT.md (update with learnings)
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (update with analysis results)
- Tests to run: None for this analysis task
- Documentation to update: AGENT.md with codebase analysis findings

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of existing MCP codebase structure
- [ ] Identification of all integration points with Ralph system
- [ ] Documentation of existing architecture patterns and conventions
- [ ] Assessment of compatibility between existing system and Ralph requirements
- [ ] Updated implementation plan with integration strategy

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Codebase Structure Analysis
- Study the directory structure and file organization
- Identify main components and their relationships
- Document the current architecture patterns
- Understand the existing build and deployment processes

### 2. Integration Point Identification
- Identify where Ralph system can integrate with existing MCP client
- Determine compatibility with existing functionality
- Assess resource sharing opportunities
- Plan seamless transition between systems

### 3. Architecture Pattern Documentation
- Document existing design patterns and conventions
- Identify reusable components and utilities
- Understand error handling and logging patterns
- Document testing and validation approaches

### 4. Compatibility Assessment
- Evaluate existing system against Ralph requirements
- Identify potential conflicts or challenges
- Assess performance and resource requirements
- Plan migration and integration strategy

## Subagent Tasks

### Analysis Subagents (Up to 100 parallel)
1. **Directory Structure Analysis**: Study and document the file/directory organization
2. **Component Analysis**: Analyze individual components and their purposes
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Map dependencies between components
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring architectural patterns
5. **Integration Analysis**: Identify potential integration points

### Research Subagents (Unlimited parallel)
1. **MCP Protocol Research**: Research MCP protocol specifications and best practices
2. **Similar System Analysis**: Research similar autonomous agent systems
3. **Integration Pattern Research**: Research integration patterns for AI systems
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Research performance benchmarks for similar systems

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with analysis results
2. Design Ralph core architecture based on findings
3. Plan file structure and organization
4. Design subagent communication protocol
