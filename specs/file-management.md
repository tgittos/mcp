# File Management Specification

## Overview
The File Management System handles persistent state storage, file-based communication between phases, and ensures data integrity across the Ralph system. It provides the foundation for the file-driven architecture that enables Ralph's deterministic behavior.

## Core Architecture

### File-Based State Management
- **Persistent Storage**: All state stored in files for reliability
- **Version Control**: Git integration for state versioning and recovery
- **Atomic Operations**: File updates are atomic to prevent corruption
- **Backup Strategy**: Automatic backup of critical files
