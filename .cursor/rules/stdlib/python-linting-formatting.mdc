      - Use automated tools like Black, Ruff, or Flake8 to enforce code style and catch errors.
      - Code should be formatted with Black and pass linting with Ruff or Flake8 before merging.
      - Fix all reported issues before committing code.
      - Integrate linting and formatting checks into CI and pre-commit hooks.
examples:
  - input: |
      def foo( x= 1 ):
          return  x+1
      def bar(): print('bad')
    output: |
      def foo(x=1):
          return x + 1
      def bar():
          print("bad")
