      - All new code should be covered by automated tests.
      - Test functions should be named test_* and reside in test modules or directories.
      - Use pytest or unittest for writing tests.
      - Use coverage.py to measure and enforce code coverage (e.g., >90%).
examples:
  - input: |
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b
      # no tests
    output: |
      def test_add():
          assert add(2, 3) == 5
