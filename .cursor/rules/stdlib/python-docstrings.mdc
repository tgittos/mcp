      - Every public module, class, and function should have a docstring (see PEP 257).
      - Use triple double quotes for docstrings.
      - The first line should be a short summary, followed by a blank line and further details if needed.
examples:
  - input: |
      def foo(x):
          return x * 2
      class Bar:
          pass
    output: |
      def foo(x):
          """Multiply x by 2.

          Args:
              x (int): The value to double.

          Returns:
              int: The doubled value.
          """
          return x * 2
      class Bar:
          """Example class docstring."""
          pass
