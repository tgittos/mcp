    message: |
      - Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
      - If a function exceeds 40 lines, consider refactoring.
      - Each function should do one thing and do it well.
examples:
  - input: |
      def process_data(data):
          # 100 lines of code
          pass
      def foo():
          a = 1
          b = 2
          return a + b
    output: |
      # Refactor into smaller functions, each with a clear purpose.
      def foo():
          return 1 + 2
